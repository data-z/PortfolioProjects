## Dataset
The dataset used includes detailed sales and gross profit figures, segmented by country, product type, and month. Key metrics include:
- **Sales YTD**: Current year-to-date sales.
- **Sales PYTD**: Previous year-to-date sales for comparison.
- **Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)**: The percentage of sales retained as profit.
- **Countries**: Canada, Colombia, Germany, and other countries with significant sales figures.

## Power BI Report

- **Canada**: Sales declined by **-73.71K**.
- **Colombia**: Experienced a drop of **-61.12K**.

## DAX Measures

Several key DAX measures were used to create this Power BI report:

1. **Sales**:
   ```DAX
   Sales = SUM(Fact_Sales[Sales_USD])
   ```

2. **Quantity**:
   ```DAX
   Quantity = SUM(Fact_Sales[quantity])
   ```

3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COG)**:
   ```DAX
   COG = SUM(Fact_Sales[COGS_USD])
   ```

4. **Gross Profit**:
   ```DAX
   Gross Profit = [Sales] - [COG]
   ```

5. **PYTD Sales**:
   ```DAX
   PYTD_Sales = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Date[Date]))
   ```

These measures enabled precise calculations for revenue, gross profit, and historical comparisons. The use of **SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR** helped create comparisons between YTD and PYTD sales, providing valuable insights into performance.

## Data Model Overview

This Power BI report is built upon a structured data model comprising fact and dimension tables:

### Fact Table
- **Fact_Sales**: Contains transactional sales data:
  - `Account_id`: Unique identifier for accounts.
  - `COGS_USD`: Cost of goods sold.
  - `Date_Time`: Date and time of each transaction.
  - `Product_id`: Unique product identifier.
  - `Quantity`: Number of products sold.
  - `Sales_USD`: Total sales in USD.

### Dimension Tables
- **Dim_Account**: Stores account information including `country`, `latitude`, `longitude`.
- **Dim_Product**: Contains product details such as `Product_Family`, `Product_Group`, `Product_Type`.
- **Dim_Date**: Supports time-based analyses with fields like `Date`.

### Measures
The project uses calculated measures for core business metrics, such as **Sales**, **Gross Profit**, and **PYTD Sales**, enhancing the reportâ€™s analytical capabilities.

By integrating this data model, the report ensures effective cross-referencing of sales, product, and account data, allowing for deep analysis and actionable insights.
