# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of any business.
Marketers can help build the companyâ€™s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales.
One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs.
By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs.
If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation. 

In this case study, I have been hired as a consultant to a bank in New York City. 
The bank has extensive data on their customers for the past 6 months. 
The marketing team at the bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.
